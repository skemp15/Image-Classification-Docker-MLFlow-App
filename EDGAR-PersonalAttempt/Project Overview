At Kubrick, we were required to explore whether identification of negative or positive sentiment in the EDGAR 10-k filings
reports can be used to predict short term movements in share prices. Specifically, we had to count the number of words 
classified as 'Negative', 'Positive' etc. (according to the Loughran-McDonald dictionary) and determine whether this has 
any affect on short-term sp500 price movements. 

This involved building several Python modules that would retrieve a list of SP500 tickers from Wikipedia, use Selenium to 
web scrape and download the annual reports for each company, and clean and convert these reports into a .txt format for the 
company for 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 day periods from the release of the reports. We where then required to show these findings 
graphically and present to the company, drawing some business insights from our findings. 

Although this work is confidential and not available to be shared, I replicated the project myself and have linked all the 
steps that were completed which are very similar to what was completed at the company but without the extensive analysis and 
business insights.
